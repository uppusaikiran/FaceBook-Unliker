Steps to use these scripts:
--------------------------
1.Goto Mozilla Firefox(Google also works,buts usually google is not best in this case)
2.Goto http://ozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imacros-for-firefox and install the add-on
3.Similarly in google store https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/imacros-for-chrome/cplklnmnlbnpmjogncfgfijoopmnlemp?hl=en
4.Restart brower

5.There are several files in the folder you downloaded all you have to do is change YOUR_USERNAME to your username
6.If u are confused,then check the Video link https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVEfJxtDOcS1RjzL3Om9nA
7.Run all the scripts only one time
8.Before beggining close all other applications to run smootly
9.Repeat the same process 2-3 days because all likes are not removed in single day
10.Facebook had a problem showing some likes even if you do all these steps,but in real your newsfeed is clean

Thanks,Happy Coding
